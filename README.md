First of all, the program will ask for your (biological, of course) sex. This is because the formula used for the body fat calculations are different for males and females.

Then, depending on sex, it prompts for your height and tape measurements of the circumferences of your abdomen (centred on your bellybutton) and neck if you're male, and additionally hip circumference if you're female. Then it'll give you the sweet numbers of the percentage of body fat in your body, as well as the mass of body fat and lean mass. 

Once you're done, type in "done" when prompted, and the program should close.
